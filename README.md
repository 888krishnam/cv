Personal Website
This is the first website made by me using HTML, CSS and a little Java Script.
It has a toggle to move between light and dark mode at the top right corner.
It has a favicon having my initial letter K of my name.
It has a circular mouse which changes colour on the basis of background colour.
The text in the website shows my Education, Skills and Hobbies.
At the last it has links to my linkedin, instagram and a contact me page.
